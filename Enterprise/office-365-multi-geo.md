In a Multi-Geo environment, your Office 365 tenant consists of a central location (where your Office 365 subscription was originally provisioned) and one or more satellite locations. In a multi-geo tenant, the information about geo locations, groups, and user information, is mastered in Azure Active Directory (AAD). Because your tenant information is mastered centrally and synchronized into each geo location, sharing and experiences involving anyone from your company contain global awareness.
