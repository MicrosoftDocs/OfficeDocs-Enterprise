# Resources to help you upgrade from Office 2010 servers and clients

Note that:

- Exchange Server 2010 will reach its end of support on **January 14, 2020**. 

- Office 2010, SharePoint 2010, and Project Server 2010 will reach their end of support on **October 13, 2020**. 

While you're planning your upgrade, this is a great time to consider moving to Office 365. 

- Office 365 has cloud-based services for Office 2010 server products such as Exchange Server and SharePoint Server and services such as Teams and OneDrive for Business. 

- Office 365 ProPlus, included with Office 365 E3 and E5 and Microsoft 365 Enterprise, is the set of Office client apps that you install on your local device. They are updated with new productivity and security features on an ongoing basis from the Microsoft cloud.

Use this article as a starting point to review your options.
