# How modern authentication works for Office 2013 and Office 2016 client apps

Read this article to learn how Office 2013 and Office 2016 client apps use modern authentication features based on the authentication configuration on the Office 365 tenant for Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Skype for Business Online.

> [!NOTE]
> Legacy client apps, such as Office 2010 and Office for Mac 2011, do not support modern authentication and can only be used with basic authentication.

## Availability of modern authentication for Office 365 services

For the Office 365 services, the default state of modern authentication is:
  
- Turned **on** for Exchange Online by default. See [Enable or disable modern authentication in Exchange Online](https://support.office.com/article/58018196-f918-49cd-8238-56f57f38d662) to turn it off or on. 
    
- Turned **on** for SharePoint Online by default. 
    
- Turned **on** for Skype for Business Online by default. See [Enable Skype for Business Online for modern authentication ](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/34339.skype-for-business-online-enable-your-tenant-for-modern-authentication.aspx)to turn it off or on.
    
## Sign-in behavior of Office client apps

Office 2013 client apps support legacy authentication by default. Legacy means that they support either Microsoft Online Sign-in Assistant or basic authentication. In order for these clients to use modern authentication features, the Windows client has have registry keys set. For instructions, see [Enable Modern Authentication for Office 2013 on Windows devices](https://support.office.com/article/7dc1c01a-090f-4971-9677-f1b192d6c910).
  
Read [How to use Modern Authentication (ADAL) with Skype for Business](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=785431) to learn about how it works with Skype for Business. 
  
Office 2016 clients support modern authentication by default, and no action is needed for the client to use these new flows. However, explicit action is needed to use legacy authentication.
