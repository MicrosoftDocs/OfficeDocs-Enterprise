# Create an Office 365 Group with a specific PDL

When users in a multi-geo environment create an Office 365 Group, the group preferred data location is automatically set to that of the user. If you need to create a group with a specific PDL, you can do that using the Exchange Online New-UnifiedGroup Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet. When you do this, both the group mailbox and SharePoint site associated with the group will be provisioned in the specified PDL.

You must be a global administrator or a SharePoint Online or Exchange Online administrator to do this.

To create an Office 365 Group with the PDL that you specify, connect to Exchange Online PowerShell and pass the parameter *-MailBoxRegion* with the geo location code.

For example: 

```PowerShell
New-UnifiedGroup -DisplayName MultiGeoEUR -Alias "MultiGeoEUR" -AccessType Public -MailboxRegion EUR 
```

Note that SharePoint group site provisioning is on-demand. The site will be provisioned the first time a group owner or member attempts to access it.
