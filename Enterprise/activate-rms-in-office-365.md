# Pointers to information about Rights Management in the admin center

This topic points to topics that describe how to enable and use RMS with Office 365.
  
You must activate the Rights Management service (RMS) before you can use the Information Rights Management (IRM) features of Office 365 applications and services. After you activate RMS, your organization can start to protect important documents and emails by using Azure RMS. This information protection solution can protect all file types and integrates with client applications like Excel, Microsoft Word, and others, Exchange Online and SharePoint Online, and servers such as Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft SharePoint.
  
> [!TIP]
