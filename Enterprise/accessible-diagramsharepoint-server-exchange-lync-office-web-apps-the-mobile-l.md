- Office Mobile is available on Windows Phone (built-in), iPhone, and Android. For iPhone and Android users, you must have a subscription to Office 365 to use this app.
    
### Office

Outside of using Office Mobile, users can view Office documents on mobile device browsers, such as Windows 8 tablets, iPads, and phones. Office Web Apps is the online companion to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote applications. Although Office Web Apps is available for multiple device browsers and manufacturers, viewing experiences can vary across devices. For example, Windows 8 tablets and iPad provide editing capabilities, whereas phones can only view these apps. An accompanying illustration shows the Office Web Apps experience on an iPad for Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Excel. It is available for both on-premises and online deployments.
  
 **High Fidelity Viewing**. You can view and share your Office documents right from the device browser, and know your documents will have the same look and polish as when they were created. An accompanying illustration shows the Office Web Apps experience on a tablet.
  
- With Word Web App, you see graphics, images, and layout with excellent fidelity, including new support for viewing and adding comments.
    
- With PowerPoint Web App, you view your presentations just as you would on your desktop, with high-resolution slides, full transitions, and viewable comments. You can also play back audio and video files right from your tablet or phone.
    
- With Excel Web App, you can change and visualize your data for deeper insights with high fidelity charts including 3D, improved Query Table and Data Validation support, Slicer functionality and Pivot Chart interactivity.
    
 **Edit in the Browser (Windows 8/iPad)**. You can make edits using essential and familiar tools with browser-based Office Web Apps. An accompanying illustration shows the Office Web Apps experience on a tablet.
  
- With Excel Web App, you get essential spreadsheet features through your browser, such as merge cells, context menus, auto-fit columns, formula assistance, fill handle and AutoSum. You can print right from your browser, and rename or add sheets as you need them.
    
- With Word Web App, you can edit, format, and design your documents right from your browser with commonly used features and shortcuts you know from Word on your desktop. 
    
- With PowerPoint Web App, you can edit text or move elements, such as pictures or charts, using a drag-and-drop operation. You can insert images, add transitions and animations, or apply a pre-designed theme right from your browser.
    
### Device Management and Software Distribution

Microsoft has new offerings for device management across multiple device brands. Windows Intune is a cloud-based management platform for mobile devices. It can be used either by itself to manage your devices, or coupled with System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager and administered within that console. Some benefits of this joint operation include:
  
- Policy enforcement and management across multiple devices including Windows RT, Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8, iOS, and Android
    
- Scale up to 100,000 devices in your organization Â· Over-the-air device enrollment
    
- User targeting of applications
    
- Performing device inventory
    
- Remote device retirement and device wipe
    
- Management from a familiar Configuration Manager console
    
An accompanying diagram shows how you can use System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager and Windows Intune for device management.
  
 **Considerations for using System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager and Windows Intune:**
  
- When using both System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager and Windows Intune, you can manage and administer all devices in your organization under one console.
    
- To connect Configuration Manager to Windows Intune, you need a Windows Intune Subscription, and the Windows Intune Connector site server role must be deployed on a server in your Configuration Manager environment.
    
- System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager provides management and software distribution for your on-premises PCs.
    
- Managed modern devices will receive policy enforcement and software distribution from Windows Intune. The supported types of devices include: Windows RT, Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8, iOS, Android.
    
## On-premises and cloud-based mobile deployments

The topologies represented here for SharePoint Server, Lync, and Exchange do not illustrate a preferred way for implementing these platforms. They merely provide an example, as topologies will differ based on unique network requirements and security considerations.
  
### SharePoint deployment

The accompanying illustration shows an extranet deployment of SharePoint Server 2013. We recommend that devices connect securely to your SharePoint 2013 web front-end servers using an option such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or a VPN gateway.
  
SharePoint can use TCP port 443 (SSL) for encrypted communication between the device and the reverse proxy. For external access from the Internet, this port needs to be opened for inbound and outbound traffic on any firewall or router. 
  
When a mobile browser accesses a site from the web front-end server, an http request is made to IIS. In the http request, the USERAGENT field contains information about the mobile browser making the request. This information can be used for browser redirection decisions for the out-of-the-box contemporary view, or a custom site implementation using the Device Channels feature.
  
For SharePoint 2013, Office Web Apps has been decoupled from the installation and is now a standalone product. To provide client access to Office Web Apps, including mobile, you need to configure SharePoint 2013 to use your installation of Office Web Apps Server. You can do so with the following SharePoint 2013 Management Shell cmdlet:
  
```
New-SPWOPIBinding -ServerName <ServerName>, where <ServerName> is the FQDN name of the URL that you set for the internal and external URLs.
```

### Exchanage deployment

A device connects to the on-premises Exchange Client Access Server that hosts applications such as, Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, the Outlook Web app, and also provides the Exchange Autodiscover service. We recommend that you use SSL encryption between the external device and the Exchange Client Access Server.
  
Device traffic like Exchange Auto Discover and Exchange ActiveSync is handled over port 443 (HTTPS). The Direct Push feature in Exchange 2013 keeps a mobile device current over a cellular or wireless network connection. It notifies the mobile device when new content is ready to be synchronized. It is important that all firewalls in your organization and carrier support a long-standing HTTPS request. By default Direct Push is configured to poll for any changes for 15 minutes in any folder and update the device. You may have to increase the time out value on a firewall if it falls beneath the default 15 minute Direct Push configuration.
  
The Exchange Client Access Server (CAS) hosts the Exchange ActiveSync service. It allows you to synchronize data between your phone or tablet and Exchange 2013. 
  
### Lync deployment

For a general workflow, an external mobile device sends an HTTPS Get request to an example external Lync URL: LyncDiscover.contoso.com. The request is received by the reverse proxy server, which forwards the request over port 443 to a Front End Server (or server pool). The reverse proxy server must have a publishing rule for LyncDiscover.contoso.com. We also recommend that the firewall and the reverse proxy server be hosted on separate computers.
  
On the Front End Server, the autodiscover service retrieves the Web service URLs for the user's home pool and returns that information to the mobile device by way of the reverse proxy server. The autodiscover service enables mobile devices to locate Lync Server Web services without requiring users to manually enter URLs.
  
If a mobile device logs on inside the firewall, a HTTPS Get command is sent directly to the Lync Front End Pool such as LyncDiscoverInternal.com. The request is received on port 443, the same port that the autodiscover service uses to communicate back to the mobile device.
  
You must configure two DNS records in order to support mobility: one for LyncDiscover.contoso.com and one for LyncDiscoverInternal.com. The external FQDN should be accessible only from outside the firewall; the internal FQDN should only be accessible from inside the firewall.
