# Navigation options for SharePoint Online

This article describes navigation options sites with SharePoint Publishing enabled in SharePoint Online. The choice and configuration of navigation significantly impacts the performance and scalability of sites in SharePoint Online.

## Overview

Navigation provider configuration can significantly impact performance for the entire site, and careful consideration must be taken to pick a navigation provider and configuration that scales effectively for the requirements of a SharePoint site. There are two out-of-the-box navigation providers, as well as custom navigation implementations.

The first option, [**Managed (Metadata) navigation**](#using-managed-navigation-and-metadata-in-sharepoint-online), is recommended, and is one of the default options in SharePoint Online; however, we recommend that security trimming be disabled unless required. Security trimming is enabled as a secure-by-default setting for this navigation provider; however, many sites do not require the overhead of security trimming since navigation elements often are consistent for all users of the site. With the recommended configuration to disable security trimming, this navigation provider does not require enumerating site structure and is highly scalable with acceptable performance impact.

The second option, [**Structural navigation**](#using-structural-navigation-in-sharepoint-online), **is NOT a recommended navigation option in SharePoint Online**. This navigation provider was designed for an on-premises topology has limited support in SharePoint Online. While it provides some additional set of capabilities versus other navigation options, these features, including security trimming and site structure enumeration, comes at a cost of excessive server calls and impacts scalability and performance when it is used. Sites using structed navigation that consume excessive resources may be subject to throttling.

In addition to the out-of-the-box navigation providers, many customers have successfully implemented alternative custom navigation implementations. One common class of custom navigation implementations embraces client-rendered design patterns that store a local cache of navigation nodes. (See **[Search-driven client-side scripting](#using-search-driven-client-side-scripting)** in this article.)

These navigation providers have a couple of key advantages: 
- They generally work well with responsive page designs.
- They are extremely scalable and performant because they can render with no resource cost (and refresh in the background after a timeout). 
- These navigation providers can retrieve navigation data using various strategies, ranging from simple static configurations to various dynamic data providers. 

An example of a data provider is to use a **Search-driven navigation**, which allows flexibility for enumerating navigation nodes and handling security trimming efficiently. 

There are other popular options to build **Custom navigation providers**. Please review [Navigation solutions for SharePoint Online portals](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/portal-navigation) for further guidance on building a Custom navigation provider.
  
## Pros and Cons of SharePoint Online navigation options

The following table summarizes the pros and cons of each option. 


|Managed navigation  |Structural navigation  |Search-driven navigation  |Custom-navigation provider  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Pros:<br/><br/>Easy to maintain<br/>Recommended option<br/>     |Pros:<br/><br/>Easy to configure<br/>Security trimmed<br/>Automatically updates as content is added<br/>|Pros:<br/><br/>Security trimmed<br/>Automatically updates as sites are added<br/>Fast loading time and locally cached navigation structure<br/>|Pros:<br/><br/>Wider choice of options available<br/>Fast loading when caching is used correctly<br/>Many options work well with responsive page design<br/>|
|Cons:<br/><br/>Not automatically updated to reflect site structure<br/>Impacts performance if security trimming is enabled<br/>|Cons:<br/><br/>**Not recommended**<br/>**Impacts performance and scalability**<br/>**Subject to throttling**<br/>|Cons:<br/><br/>No ability to easily order sites<br/>Requires customization of the master page (technical skills required)<br/>|Cons:<br/><br/>Custom development is required<br/>External data source / cache stored is needed e.g. Azure<br/>|

The most appropriate option for your site will depend on your site requirements and on your technical capability. If you want a scalable out-of-the-box navigation provider, then Managed navigation with security trimming disabled is a very good option. 

The Managed navigation option can be maintained through configuration, does not involve code customization files, and it is significantly faster than structural navigation. If you require security trimming and are comfortable using a custom master page and have some capability in the organization to maintain the changes that may occur in the default master page for SharePoint Online, then the Search-driven option may produce a better user experience. If you have more complex requirements, then a custom navigation provider may be the right choice. Structural navigation is NOT recommended.

Finally, it’s important to note that SharePoint is adding additional navigation providers and functionality for modern SharePoint site architectures leveraging a more flattened site hierarchy and a hub-and-spoke model with SharePoint hub sites. This allows many scenarios to be achieved that do NOT require the use of SharePoint Publishing feature, and these navigation configurations are optimized for scalability and latency within SharePoint Online. Note that applying the same principle - simplifying the overall structure of your SharePoint Publishing site to a flatter structure, often helps with overall performance and scale as well. What this means is that instead of having a single Site Collection with hundreds of sites (subwebs), a better approach is to have many site collections with very few subsites (subwebs).


## Using managed navigation and metadata in SharePoint Online

Managed navigation is another out-of-the-box option that you can use to recreate most of the same functionality as structural navigation. Managed metadata can be configured to have security trimming enabled or disabled. When configured with security trimming disabled, managed navigation is fairly efficient as it loads all the navigation links with a constant number of server calls. Enabling security trimming, however, negates some of the advantages of managed navigation, and customers may choose to explore one of the custom navigation solutions for optimal performance and scalability.

Many sites do not require security trimming, as the navigation structure is often consistent for all users of the site. If security trimming is disabled and a link is added to navigation that not all users have access to, the link will still show but will lead to an access denied message. There is no risk of inadvertent access to the content.

### How to implement managed navigation and the results

There are several articles on Docs.Microsoft.com about the details of managed navigation, for example, see [Overview of managed navigation in SharePoint Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/administration/overview-of-managed-navigation).

In order to implement managed navigation, you set up terms with URLs corresponding to the navigation structure of  the site. Managed navigation can even be manually curated to replace structural navigation in many cases. For example:

![SharePoint Online site structure](media/SPONavOptionsListOfSites.png)

The following example shows the performance of the complex navigation using managed navigation.

![Performance of complex navigation using managed navigation](media/SPONavOptionsComplexNavPerf.png)

Using managed navigation consistently improves performance compared to the structural navigation approach.
  
## Using structural navigation in SharePoint Online

This is the out-of-the-box navigation used by default and is the most straightforward solution but as such has an expensive performance trade-off. It does not require any customization and a non-technical user can also easily add items, hide items, and manage the navigation from the settings page. This is however also true for Managed Navigation so it is recommended to use Managed Navigation as that can also be easily managed and controlled as well with improved performance.

### Turning on structural navigation in SharePoint Online

To illustrate how the performance in a standard SharePoint Online solution with structural navigation and the show subsites option turned on. Below is a screenshot of settings found on the page **Site Settings** \> **Navigation**.
  
![Screenshot showing subsites](media/5b6a8841-34ed-4f61-b6d3-9d3e78d393e7.png)
  
### Analyzing structural navigation performance in SharePoint Online

To analyze the performance of a SharePoint page, use the **Network** tab of the F12 developer tools in Internet Explorer. 
  
![Screenshot showing F12 dev tools Network tab](media/SPONavOptionsNetworks.png)
  
1. On the **Network** tab, click on the .aspx page that is being loaded and then click on the **Details** tab.<br/> ![Screenshot showing the details tab](media/ad85cefb-7bc5-4932-b29c-25f61b4ceeb2.png)<br/>
2. Click **Response headers**. <br/>![Screenshot of Details tab](media/c47770ac-5b2b-4941-9830-c57565dec4cc.png)<br/>SharePoint returns some useful diagnostic information in its response headers. 
3. One of the most useful pieces of information is **SPRequestDuration** which is the value, in milliseconds, of how long a request took to process on the server. In the following screenshot **show subsites** is unchecked for the structural navigation. This means that there is only the site collection link in the global navigation:<br/>![Screenshot showing load times as request duration](media/3422b2e8-15ec-4bb9-ba86-0965b6b49b01.png)<br/>
4. The **SPRequestDuration** key has a value of 245 milliseconds. This represents the time it took to return the request. Since there is only one navigation item on the site, this is a good benchmark for how SharePoint Online performs without heavy navigation. The next screen shot shows how adding in the subsites affects this key.<br/>![Screenshot showing a request duration of 2502 ms](media/618ee4e9-2ffa-4a22-b638-fa77b72292b8.png)<br/>
  
Adding the subsites has significantly increased the time it takes to return the page request for this relatively simple sample site. Complex site hierarchies, including pages in navigation, and other configuration and topology options can dramatically increase this impact even further.

## Using Search-driven client-side scripting

Using search you can leverage the indexes that are built up in the background using continuous crawl. The search results are pulled from the search index and the results are security-trimmed. This is generally faster than out-of-the-box navigation providers when security trimming is required. Using search for structural navigation, especially if you have a complex site structure, will speed up page loading time considerably. The main advantage of this over managed navigation is that you benefit from security trimming.

This approach involves creating a custom master page and replacing the out-of-the-box navigation code with custom HTML. Follow this procedure outlined in the following example to replace the navigation code in the file `seattle.html`. In this example, you will open the `seattle.html` file and replace the whole element `id=”DeltaTopNavigation”` with custom HTML code.

### Example: Replace the out-of-the-box navigation code in a master page

1.	Navigate to the Site Settings page.
2.	Open the master page gallery by clicking **Master Pages**.
3.	From here you can navigate through the library and download the file `seattle.master`.
4.	Edit the code using a text editor and delete the code block in the following screen shot.<br/>![Delete the code block shown](media/SPONavOptionsDeleteCodeBlock.png)<br/>
5. Remove the code between the `<SharePoint:AjaxDelta id=”DeltaTopNavigation”>` and `<\SharePoint:AjaxDelta>` tags and replace it with the following snippet:<br/>

```
<div id="loading">
  <!--Replace with path to loading image.-->
  <div style="background-image: url(''); height: 22px; width: 22px; ">
  </div>
</div>
<!-- Main Content-->
<div id="navContainer" style="display:none">
    <div data-bind="foreach: hierarchy" class="noindex ms-core-listMenu-horizontalBox">
        <a class="dynamic menu-item ms-core-listMenu-item ms-displayInline ms-navedit-linkNode" data-bind="attr: { href: item.Url, title: item.Title }">

                        </span>
                    </span>
                <!-- /ko -->
                <!-- ko if: children.length == 0-->   
                    <span aria-haspopup="true" class="ms-navedit-flyoutArrow dynamic-children">

                        </span>
                    </span>
                <!-- /ko -->   
                </a>
               
                <!-- ko if: children.length > 0-->                                                       
                <ul id="menu"  data-bind="foreach: children;" class="dynamic  level2" >
                    <li class="dynamic level2">
                        <a class="dynamic menu-item ms-core-listMenu-item ms-displayInline  ms-navedit-linkNode" data-bind="attr: { href: item.Url, title: item.Title }">
         
          <!-- ko if: children.length > 0-->
          <span aria-haspopup="true" class="additional-background ms-navedit-flyoutArrow dynamic-children">
           <span class="menu-item-text" data-bind="text: item.Title">
           </span>
          </span>
           <!-- /ko -->
          <!-- ko if: children.length == 0-->
          <span aria-haspopup="true" class="ms-navedit-flyoutArrow dynamic-children">
           <span class="menu-item-text" data-bind="text: item.Title">
           </span>
          </span>                 
          <!-- /ko -->   
                        </a>
          <!-- ko if: children.length > 0-->
         <ul id="menu" data-bind="foreach: children;" class="dynamic level3" >
          <li class="dynamic level3">
           <a class="dynamic menu-item ms-core-listMenu-item ms-displayInline ms-navedit-linkNode" data-bind="attr: { href: item.Url, title: item.Title }">
            <span class="menu-item-text" data-bind="text: item.Title">
            </span>
           </a>
          </li>
         </ul>
           <!-- /ko -->
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <!-- /ko -->
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
```
<br/>
6. Replace the URL in the loading image anchor tag at the beginning, with a link to a loading image in your site collection. After you have made the changes, rename the file and then upload it to the master page gallery. This generates a new .master file.<br/>
7. This HTML is the basic markup that will be populated by the search results returned from JavaScript code. You will need to edit the code to change the value for var root = “site collection URL” as demonstrated in the following snippet:<br/>

```
var root = “https://spperformance.sharepoint.com/sites/NavigationBySearch”;
```
<br/>
8. The results are assigned to the self.nodes array and a hierarchy is built out of the objects using linq.js assigning the output to an array self.hierarchy. This array is the object that is bound to the HTML. This is done in the toggleView() function by passing the self object to the ko.applyBinding() function.<br/>This then causes the hierarchy array to be bound to the following HTML:<br/>

```
<div data-bind=”foreach: hierarchy” class=”noindex ms-core-listMenu-horizontalBox”>
```

The event handlers for `mouseenter` and `mouseexit` are added to the top-level navigation to handle the subsite drop-down menus which is done in the `addEventsToElements()` function.

In our complex navigation example, a fresh page load without the local caching shows the time spent on the server has been cut down from the benchmark structural navigation to get a similar result as the managed navigation approach.

### About the JavaScript file...

The entire JavaScript file is as follows:

```
//Models and Namespaces
var SPOCustom = SPOCustom || {};
SPOCustom.Models = SPOCustom.Models || {}
SPOCustom.Models.NavigationNode = function () {

    this.Url = ko.observable("");
    this.Title = ko.observable("");
    this.Parent = ko.observable("");

};

var root = "https://spperformance.sharepoint.com/sites/NavigationBySearch";
var baseUrl = root + "/_api/search/query?querytext=";
var query = baseUrl + "'contentClass=\"STS_Web\"+path:" + root + "'&trimduplicates=false&rowlimit=300";

var baseRequest = {
    url: "",
    type: ""
};


//Parses a local object from JSON search result.
function getNavigationFromDto(dto) {
    var item = new SPOCustom.Models.NavigationNode();
    if (dto != undefined) {

        var webTemplate = getSearchResultsValue(dto.Cells.results, 'WebTemplate');

        if (webTemplate != "APP") {
            item.Title(getSearchResultsValue(dto.Cells.results, 'Title')); //Key = Title
            item.Url(getSearchResultsValue(dto.Cells.results, 'Path')); //Key = Path
            item.Parent(getSearchResultsValue(dto.Cells.results, 'ParentLink')); //Key = ParentLink
        }

    }
    return item;
}

function getSearchResultsValue(results, key) {

    for (i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {
        if (results[i].Key == key) {
            return results[i].Value;
        }
    }
    return null;
}

//Parse a local object from the serialized cache.
function getNavigationFromCache(dto) {
    var item = new SPOCustom.Models.NavigationNode();

    if (dto != undefined) {

        item.Title(dto.Title);
        item.Url(dto.Url);
        item.Parent(dto.Parent);
    }

    return item;
}

/* create a new OData request for JSON response */

          var position = $(this).position();
          console.log(JSON.stringify(position));
          $(this).find("ul.level3").css({ width: 100, left: position.left + 95, top:  position.top});
      })

``` 

To summarize the code shown above in the `jQuery $(document).ready` function there is a `viewModel object` created and then the `loadNavigationNodes()` function on that object is called. This function either loads the previously built navigation hierarchy stored in the HTML5 local storage of the client browser or it calls the function `queryRemoteInterface()`.

`QueryRemoteInterface()` builds a request using the `getRequest()` function with the query parameter defined earlier in the script and then returns data from the server. This data is essentially an array of all the sites in the site collection represented as data transfer objects with various properties. 

This data is then parsed into the previously defined `SPO.Models.NavigationNode` objects which use `Knockout.js` to create observable properties for use by data binding the values into the HTML that we defined earlier. 

The objects are then put into a results array. This array is parsed into JSON using Knockout and stored in the local browser storage for improved performance on future page loads.

### Benefits of this approach

One major benefit of [this approach](#example-replace-the-out-of-the-box-navigation-code-in-a-master-page) is that by using HTML5 local storage, the navigation is stored locally for the user the next time they load the page. We get major performance improvements from using the search API for structural navigation; however, it takes some technical capability to execute and customize this functionality. 

In the [example implementation](#example-replace-the-out-of-the-box-navigation-code-in-a-master-page), the sites are ordered in the same way as the out-of-the-box structural navigation; alphabetical order. If you wanted to deviate from this order, it would be more complicated to develop and maintain. Also, this approach requires you to deviate from the supported master pages. If the custom master page is not maintained, your site will miss out on updates and improvements that Microsoft makes to the master pages.

The [above code](#about-the-javascript-file) has the following dependencies:

- jQuery - http://jquery.com/
- KnockoutJS - http://knockoutjs.com/
- Linq.js - http://linqjs.codeplex.com/, or github.com/neuecc/linq.js

The current version of LinqJS does not contain the ByHierarchy method used in the above code and will break the navigation code. To fix this, add the following method to the Linq.js file before the line `Flatten: function ()`.

```
ByHierarchy: function(firstLevel, connectBy, orderBy, ascending, parent) {
     ascending = ascending == undefined ? true : ascending;
     var orderMethod = ascending == true ? 'OrderBy' : 'OrderByDescending';
     var source = this;
     firstLevel = Utils.CreateLambda(firstLevel);
     connectBy = Utils.CreateLambda(connectBy);
     orderBy = Utils.CreateLambda(orderBy);
    
     //Initiate or increase level
     var level = parent === undefined ? 1 : parent.level + 1;

    return new Enumerable(function() {
         var enumerator;
         var index = 0;

        var createLevel = function() {
                 var obj = {
                     item: enumerator.Current(),
                     level : level
                 };
                 obj.children = Enumerable.From(source).ByHierarchy(firstLevel, connectBy, orderBy, ascending, obj);
                 if (orderBy !== undefined) {
                     obj.children = obj.children[orderMethod](function(d) {
                         return orderBy(d.item); //unwrap the actual item for sort to work
                     });
                 }
                 obj.children = obj.children.ToArray();
                 Enumerable.From(obj.children).ForEach(function(child) {
                     child.getParent = function() {
                         return obj;
                     };
                 });
                 return obj;
             };

        return new IEnumerator(

        function() {
             enumerator = source.GetEnumerator();
         }, function() {
             while (enumerator.MoveNext()) {
                 var returnArr;
                 if (!parent) {
                     if (firstLevel(enumerator.Current(), index++)) {
                         return this.Yield(createLevel());
                     }

                } else {
                     if (connectBy(parent.item, enumerator.Current(), index++)) {
                         return this.Yield(createLevel());
                     }
                 }
             }
             return false;
         }, function() {
             Utils.Dispose(enumerator);
         })
     });
 },

```
