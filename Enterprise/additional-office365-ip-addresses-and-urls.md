# Additional endpoints not included in the Office 365 IP Address and URL Web service

Some network endpoints were previously published and have not been included in the [Office 365 IP Address and URL Web Service](office-365-ip-web-service.md). The web service scope is network endpoints that are required for connectivity from a user of Office 365 across an enterprise perimeter network. This currently does not include:

1. Network connectivity that may be required from a Microsoft datacenter to a customer network (inbound hybrid server network traffic).
2. Network connectivity from servers on a customer network across the enterprise perimeter (outbound server network traffic).
3. Uncommon scenarios for network connectivity requirements from a user.
4. DNS resolution connectivity requirement (not listed below).
5. Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge Trusted Sites.

Apart from DNS, these are all optional for most customers unless you need the specific scenario that is described.

When mailbox migration is initiated from on-premises [Exchange Hybrid](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/exchange-deployment-assistant) to Office 365, Office 365 will connect to your published Exchange Web Services (EWS)/Mailbox Replication Services (MRS) server. If you need the NAT IP addresses used by Exchange Online servers to restrict inbound connections from specific source IP ranges, they are listed in [Office 365 URL & IP ranges](urls-and-ip-address-ranges.md) under the "Exchange Online" service area. Care should be taken to ensure that access to published EWS endpoints like OWA is not impacted by ensuring the MRS proxy resolves to a separate FQDN and public IP address before restricting TCP 443 connections from specific source IP ranges. | Customer on-premises EWS/MRS Proxy<br> TCP port 443 | Inbound server traffic |
