# Deploy Office 365 Enterprise for your organization

## Self-deployment of Office 365 Enterprise

Deploying Office 365 Enterprise on your own requires that you perform detailed research to make the design decisions that streamline cloud service configuration and user adoption. Start your planning [here](get-your-organization-ready-for-office-365.md).

To deploy Office 365 Enterprise on your own, here are the recommended steps.

1. Set up your network

   Includes adding your Internet domains and optimizing the network performance for your on-premises users. Start [here](set-up-network-for-office-365.md).
 
2. Set up your identities

   Includes determining an identity model (cloud-only or hybrid), and for hybrid identity, setting up directory synchronization between your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and your Office 365 subscription. Start [here](protect-your-global-administrator-accounts.md).

3. Implement security capabilities

   Includes configuring and rolling out basic and enhanced security, threat, and information protections for your tenant and identities in the first 30 days, 90 days, and beyond. Start [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/security-roadmap).
 
4. Deploy client software

   Includes deploying Office 365 ProPlus, the cloud-updated and always-current version of the Office suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and others) on your devices. Every Office 365 client license includes a license for Office 365 ProPlus. Start [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/deployment-guide-for-office-365-proplus).
 
5. Set up mobile device management

   Office 365 Enterprise includes mobile device management capabilities that help you secure and manage your users' mobile devices. Start [here](https://support.office.com/article/set-up-mobile-device-management-mdm-in-office-365-dd892318-bc44-4eb1-af00-9db5430be3cd).
 
6. Configure services and applications

   Includes information on migration of your data and links to articles that get you started on key Office 365 services such as Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Teams. Start [here](configure-services-and-applications.md).
 
7. Train your users

   Includes short videos that help your users get the most out of Office 365 quickly. Start [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/admin-overview/get-started-with-office-365#training-resources-for-your-users).
