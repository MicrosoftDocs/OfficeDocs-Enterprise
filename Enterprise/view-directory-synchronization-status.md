# View directory synchronization status in Office 365

If you have integrated your on-premises Active Directory with Azure AD by synchronizing your on-premises environment with Office 365, you can also check the status of your synchronization.
  
## View directory synchronization status

- Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) and choose **DirSync Status** on the home page.
- Alternately, you can go to **Users** \> **Active users**, and on the **Active users** page, choose **More** \> **Directory synchronization**. On the **Directory Synchronization** pane, choose **Go to DirSync management**.

## Information on the Manage directory synchronization page

The following table lists the features you can get information about on the page.
  
If there is a problem with your directory synchronization, the errors are listed on this page as well. For more information about different errors you might encounter, see [Identify directory synchronization errors in Office 365](identify-directory-synchronization-errors.md).
