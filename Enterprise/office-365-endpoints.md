# Office 365 endpoints

**Summary:** See these articles for the Internet endpoints of the different Office 365 clouds.
  
Endpoints are the set of destination IP addresses, DNS domain names, and URLs for Office 365 traffic on the Internet. 

To optimize performance to Office 365 cloud-based services, these endpoints need special handling by your client browsers and the devices in your edge network. These devices include firewalls, SSL Break and Inspect and packet inspection devices, and data loss prevention systems.

See [Managing Office 365 endpoints](managing-office-365-endpoints.md) for the details.

There are currently five different Office 365 clouds. This table takes you to the list of endpoints for each one.
