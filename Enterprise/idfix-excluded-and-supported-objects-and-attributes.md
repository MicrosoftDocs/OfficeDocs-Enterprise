# IdFix excluded and supported objects and attributes
There are two sets of rules maintained by IdFix; Multi-tenant and Dedicated/ITAR. At this time, the two rule sets exclude the same objects, attributes, and attribute values from its search. This may change in future releases.
  
## Multi-tenant and Dedicated error exclusions used by IdFix
This section lists the objects, attributes, and values that IdFix excludes from its search of the directory. The asterisk (\*) is a wildcard that can be substituted for other characters.
