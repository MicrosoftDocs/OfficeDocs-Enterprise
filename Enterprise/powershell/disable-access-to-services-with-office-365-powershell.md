# Disable access to services with Office 365 PowerShell

**Summary:** Explains how to use Office 365 PowerShell to disable access to Office 365 services for users in your organization.
  
When an Office 365 account is assigned a license from a licensing plan, Office 365 services are made available to the user from that license. However, you can control the Office 365 services that the user can access. For example, even though the license allows access to the SharePoint Online service, you can disable access to it. You can use PowerShell to disable access to any number of services for a specific licensing plan for:

- An individual account.
    
- A group of accounts.
    
- All accounts in your organization.

## Use the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell

First, [connect to your Office 365 tenant](connect-to-office-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-microsoft-azure-active-directory-module-for-windows-powershell).

Next, use this command to view your available licensing plans, also known as AccountSkuIds:

```
Get-MsolAccountSku | Select AccountSkuId | Sort AccountSkuId
```

For more information, see [View licenses and services with Office 365 PowerShell](view-licenses-and-services-with-office-365-powershell.md).
    
To see the before and after results of the procedures in this topic, see [View account license and service details with Office 365 PowerShell](view-account-license-and-service-details-with-office-365-powershell.md).
    
A PowerShell script is available that automates the procedures described in this topic. Specifically, the script lets you view and disable services in your Office 365 organization, including Sway. For more information, see [Disable access to Sway with Office 365 PowerShell](disable-access-to-sway-with-office-365-powershell.md).
    
    
### Disable specific Office 365 services for specific users for a specific licensing plan
  
To disable a specific set of Office 365 services for users for a specific licensing plan, perform the following steps:
  
1. Identify the undesirable services in the licensing plan by using the following syntax:
    
  ```
  $LO = New-MsolLicenseOptions -AccountSkuId <AccountSkuId> -DisabledPlans "<UndesirableService1>", "<UndesirableService2>"...
  ```

  The following example creates a **LicenseOptions** object that disables the Office and SharePoint Online services in the licensing plan named `litwareinc:ENTERPRISEPACK` (Office 365 Enterprise E3).
    
  ```
  $LO = New-MsolLicenseOptions -AccountSkuId "litwareinc:ENTERPRISEPACK" -DisabledPlans "SHAREPOINTWAC", "SHAREPOINTENTERPRISE"
  ```

2. Use the **LicenseOptions** object from Step 1 on one or more users.
    
  - To create a new account that has the services disabled, use the following syntax:
    
  ```
  New-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName <Account> -DisplayName <DisplayName> -FirstName <FirstName> -LastName <LastName> -LicenseAssignment <AccountSkuId> -LicenseOptions $LO -UsageLocation <CountryCode>
  ```

  The following example creates a new account for Allie Bellew that assigns the license and disables the services described in Step 1.
    
  ```
  New-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName allieb@litwareinc.com -DisplayName "Allie Bellew" -FirstName Allie -LastName Bellew -LicenseAssignment litwareinc:ENTERPRISEPACK -LicenseOptions $LO -UsageLocation US
  ```

  For more information about creating user accounts in Office 365 PowerShell, see [Create user accounts with Office 365 PowerShell](create-user-accounts-with-office-365-powershell.md).
    
  - To disable the services for an existing licensed user, use the following syntax:
    
  ```
  Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName <Account> -LicenseOptions $LO
  ```

  This example disables the services for the user BelindaN@litwareinc.com.
    
  ```
  Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName belindan@litwareinc.com -LicenseOptions $LO
  ```

  - To disable the services described in Step 1 for all existing licensed users, specify the name of your Office 365 plan from the display of the **Get-MsolAccountSku** cmdlet (such as **litwareinc:ENTERPRISEPACK**), and then run the following commands:
    
  ```
  $acctSKU="<AccountSkuId>"
  $AllLicensed = Get-MsolUser -All | Where {$_.isLicensed -eq $true -and $_.licenses[0].AccountSku.SkuPartNumber -eq ($acctSKU).Substring($acctSKU.IndexOf(":")+1, $acctSKU.Length-$acctSKU.IndexOf(":")-1)}
  $AllLicensed | ForEach {Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $_.UserPrincipalName -LicenseOptions $LO}
  ```

  If you use the **Get-MsolUser** cmdlet without using the _All_ parameter, only the first 500 user accounts are returned.


  - To disable the services for a group of existing users, use either of the following methods to identify the users:
    
  - **Filter the accounts based on an existing account attribute** To do this, use the following syntax:
    
  ```
  $x = Get-MsolUser -All <FilterableAttributes>
  $x | ForEach {Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $_.UserPrincipalName -LicenseOptions $LO}
  ```

  The following example disables the services for users in the Sales department in the United States.
    
  ```
  $USSales = Get-MsolUser -All -Department "Sales" -UsageLocation "US"
  $USSales | ForEach {Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $_.UserPrincipalName -LicenseOptions $LO}
  ```

  - **Use a list of specific accounts** To do this, perform the following steps:
    
1. Create a text file that contains one account on each line like this:
    
  ```
  akol@contoso.com
  tjohnston@contoso.com
  kakers@contoso.com
  ```

  In this example, the text file is C:\\My Documents\\Accounts.txt.
    
2. Run the following command:
    
  ```
  Get-Content "C:\My Documents\Accounts.txt" | foreach {Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $_ -LicenseOptions $LO}
  ```

If you want to disable access to services for multiple licensing plans, repeat the above instructions for each licensing plan, ensuring that:

- The user accounts have been assigned the licensing plan.
- The services to disable are available in the licensing plan.

To disable Office 365 services for users while you are assigning them to a licensing plan, see [Disable access to services while assigning user licenses](disable-access-to-services-while-assigning-user-licenses.md).
