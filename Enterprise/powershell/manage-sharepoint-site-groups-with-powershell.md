# Manage SharePoint Online site groups with Office 365 PowerShell

 **Summary:** Use Office 365 PowerShell to manage SharePoint Online site groups.
  
Although you can use the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can also use Office 365 PowerShell to manage your SharePoint Online site groups.

## Before you begin

The procedures in this article require you to connect to SharePoint Online. For instructions, see [Connect to SharePoint Online PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online?view=sharepoint-ps).

## View SharePoint Online with Office 365 PowerShell

The SharePoint Online admin center has some easy-to-use methods for managing site groups. For example, suppose you want to look at the groups, and the group members, for the `https://litwareinc.sharepoint.com/sites/finance` site. Hereâ€™s what you have to do to:

1. From the Microsoft 365 admin center, click **Resources** > **Sites**, and then click the URL of the site.
2. In the site collection dialog box, click **Go to this site**.
3. On the site page, click the **Settings** icon (located in the upper right-hand corner of the page) and then click **Site settings**:<br/>
![SharePoint Online site settings](media/spo-site-settings.png)<br/>
4. On the Site Settings page, click **Sites permissions** under **Users and Permissions**.

And then repeat the process for the next site you want to look at.

To get a list of the groups with Office 365 PowerShell, you would use the following command set:

```
$siteURL = "https://litwareinc.sharepoint.com/sites/finance"
$x = Get-SPOSiteGroup -Site $siteURL
foreach ($y in $x)
    {
        Write-Host $y.Title -ForegroundColor "Yellow"
        Get-SPOSiteGroup -Site $siteURL -Group $y.Title | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Users
        Write-Host
    }
```

There are two ways to run this command set in the SharePoint Online Management Shell command prompt:

- Copy the commands into Notepad (or another text editor), modify the value of the **$siteURL** variable, select the commands, and then paste them into the SharePoint Online Management Shell command prompt. When you do, PowerShell will stop at a **>>** prompt. Press Enter to execute the **foreach** command.<br/>
- Copy the commands into Notepad (or another text editor), modify the value of the **$siteURL** variable, and then save this text file with a name and the .ps1 extension in a suitable folder. Next, run the script from the SharePoint Online Management Shell command prompt by specifying its path and file name. Here is an example command:

```
C:\Scripts\SiteGroupsAndUsers.ps1
```

In both cases, you should see something similar to this:

![SharePoint Online site groups](media/SPO-site-groups.png)

These are all the groups that have been created for the site `https://litwareinc.sharepoint.com/sites/finance`, and all the users assigned to those groups. The group names are in yellow to help you separate group names from their members.

As another example, here is a command set that lists the groups, and all the group memberships, for all of your SharePoint Online sites.

```
$x = Get-SPOSite
foreach ($y in $x)
    {
        Write-Host $y.Url -ForegroundColor "Yellow"
        $z = Get-SPOSiteGroup -Site $y.Url
        foreach ($a in $z)
            {
                 $b = Get-SPOSiteGroup -Site $y.Url -Group $a.Title 
                 Write-Host $b.Title -ForegroundColor "Cyan"
                 $b | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Users
                 Write-Host
            }
    }
```
