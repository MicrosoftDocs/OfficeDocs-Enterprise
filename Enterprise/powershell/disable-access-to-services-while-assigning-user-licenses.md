# Disable access to services while assigning user licenses

**Summary:**  Learn how to assign licenses to user accounts and disable specific service plans at the same time using Office 365 PowerShell.
  
Office 365 subscriptions come with service plans for individual services. Office 365 administrators often need to disable certain plans when assigning licenses to users. With the instructions in this article, you can assign an Office 365 license while disabling specific service plans using PowerShell for an individual user account or multiple user accounts.


## Use the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell

First, [connect to your Office 365 tenant](connect-to-office-365-powershell.md#connect-with-the-microsoft-azure-active-directory-module-for-windows-powershell).

Next, run this command to see your current subscriptions:
  
```
Get-MsolAccountSku
```

In the display of the  `Get-MsolAccountSku` command:
  
- **AccountSkuId** is a subscription for your organization in \<OrganizationName>:\<Subscription> format. The \<OrganizationName> is the value that you provided when you enrolled in Office 365, and is unique for your organization. The \<Subscription> value is for a specific subscription. For example, for litwareinc:ENTERPRISEPACK, the organization name is litwareinc, and the subscription name is ENTERPRISEPACK (Office 365 Enterprise E3).
    
- **ActiveUnits** is the number of licenses that you've purchased for the subscription.
    
- **WarningUnits** is the number of licenses in a subscription that you haven't renewed, and that will expire after the 30-day grace period.
    
- **ConsumedUnits** is the number of licenses that you've assigned to users for the subscription.
    
Note the AccountSkuId for your Office 365 subscription that contains the users you want to license. Also, ensure that there are enough licenses to assign (subtract **ConsumedUnits** from **ActiveUnits** ).
  
Next, run this command to see the details about the Office 365 service plans that are available in all your subscriptions:
  
```
Get-MsolAccountSku | Select -ExpandProperty ServiceStatus
```

From the display of this command, determine which service plans you would like to disable when you assign licenses to users.
  
Here is a partial list of service plans and their corresponding Office 365 services.

The following table shows the Office 365 service plans and their friendly names for the most common services. Your list of service plans might be different. 
  
|**Service plan**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| `SWAY` <br/> |Sway  <br/> |
| `TEAMS1` <br/> |Microsoft Teams  <br/> |
| `YAMMER_ENTERPRISE` <br/> |Yammer  <br/> |
| `RMS_S_ENTERPRISE` <br/> |Azure Rights Management (RMS)  <br/> |
| `OFFICESUBSCRIPTION` <br/> |Office Professional Plus  <br/> |
| `MCOSTANDARD` <br/> |Skype for Business Online  <br/> |
| `SHAREPOINTWAC` <br/> |Office   <br/> |
| `SHAREPOINTENTERPRISE` <br/> |SharePoint Online  <br/> |
| `EXCHANGE_S_ENTERPRISE` <br/> |Exchange Online Plan 2  <br/> |
   
For a complete list of license plans (also known as product names), their included service plans, and their corresponding friendly names, see [Product names and service plan identifiers for licensing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/licensing-service-plan-reference).
   
Now that you have the AccountSkuId and the service plans to disable, you can assign licenses for an individual user or for multiple users.
  
### For a single user

For a single user, fill in the user principal name of the user account, the AccountSkuId, and the list of service plans to disable and remove the explanatory text and the \< and > characters. Then, run the resulting commands at the PowerShell command prompt.
  
```
$userUPN="<the user's account name in email format>"
$accountSkuId="<the AccountSkuId from the Get-MsolAccountSku command>"
$planList=@( <comma-separated, double-quote enclosed list of the service plans to disable> )
$licenseOptions=New-MsolLicenseOptions -AccountSkuId $accountSkuId -DisabledPlans $planList
$user=Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName $userUPN
$usageLocation=$user.Usagelocation
Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $userUpn -AddLicenses $accountSkuId -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Sleep -Seconds 5
Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $userUpn -LicenseOptions $licenseOptions -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName $userUpn -UsageLocation $usageLocation
```

Here is an example command block for the account named belindan@contoso.com, for the contoso:ENTERPRISEPACK license, and the service plans to disable are RMS_S_ENTERPRISE, SWAY, INTUNE_O365, and YAMMER_ENTERPRISE:
  
```
$userUPN="belindan@contoso.com"
$accountSkuId="contoso:ENTERPRISEPACK"
$planList=@( "RMS_S_ENTERPRISE","SWAY","INTUNE_O365","YAMMER_ENTERPRISE" )
$licenseOptions=New-MsolLicenseOptions -AccountSkuId $accountSkuId -DisabledPlans $planList
$user=Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName $userUPN
$usageLocation=$user.Usagelocation
Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $userUpn -AddLicenses $accountSkuId -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Sleep -Seconds 5
Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $userUpn -LicenseOptions $licenseOptions -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName $userUpn -UsageLocation $UsageLocation
```

### For multiple users

To perform this administration task for multiple users, create a comma-separated value (CSV) text file that contains the UserPrincipalName and UsageLocation fields. Here is an example:
  
```
UserPrincipalName,UsageLocation
ClaudeL@contoso.onmicrosoft.com,FR
LynneB@contoso.onmicrosoft.com,US
ShawnM@contoso.onmicrosoft.com,US
```

Next, fill in the location of the input and output CSV files, the account SKU ID, and the list of service plans to disable, and then run the resulting commands at the PowerShell command prompt.
  
```
$inFileName="<path and file name of the input CSV file that contains the users, example: C:\admin\Users2License.CSV>"
$outFileName="<path and file name of the output CSV file that records the results, example: C:\admin\Users2License-Done.CSV>"
$accountSkuId="<the AccountSkuId from the Get-MsolAccountSku command>"
$planList=@( <comma-separated, double-quote enclosed list of the plans to disable> )
$users=Import-Csv $inFileName
$licenseOptions=New-MsolLicenseOptions -AccountSkuId $accountSkuId -DisabledPlans $planList
ForEach ($user in $users)
{
$user.Userprincipalname
$upn=$user.UserPrincipalName
$usageLocation=$user.UsageLocation
Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $upn -AddLicenses $accountSkuId -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
sleep -Seconds 5
Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $upn -LicenseOptions $licenseOptions -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName $upn -UsageLocation $usageLocation
$users | Get-MsolUser | Select UserPrincipalName, Islicensed,Usagelocation | Export-Csv $outFileName
}
```

This PowerShell command block:
  
- Displays the user principal name of each user.
    
- Assigns customized licenses to each user.
    
- Creates a CSV file with all the users that were processed and shows their license status.
