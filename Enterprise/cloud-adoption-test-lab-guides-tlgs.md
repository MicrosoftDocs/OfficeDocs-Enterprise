# Test Office 365 with Test Lab Guides (TLGs)

 **Summary:** Use these articles to set up demonstration, proof of concept, or dev/test environments for Office 365.
  
TLGs help you quickly learn about Microsoft products. They're great for situations where you need to evaluate a technology or configuration before you decide whether it's right for you and before you begin the design, planning, and rollout to users. The "I built it out myself and it works" hands-on experience helps you understand the deployment requirements of a new product or solution so you can better plan for hosting it in production.
  
TLGs also create representative environments for development and testing of applications, also known as dev/test environments.

## Office 365 dev/test environment

Use these articles to build your Office 365 dev/test environment:
  
- [Base Configuration dev/test environment](base-configuration-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Create a simplified intranet running in Microsoft Azure infrastructure services. This is an optional step if you want to build a simulated enterprise configuration.
    
- [Office 365 dev/test environment](office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Create an Office 365 Enterprise E5 trial subscription, which you can do from your computer or from a simplified intranet running in Azure infrastructure services.
    
- [Directory synchronization](dirsync-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Install and configure Azure AD Connect for directory synchronization with password hash synchronization. This is an optional step if you want to build a simulated enterprise configuration.
    
For your Office 365 dev/test environment, use these articles to demonstrate enterprise features of Office 365:
  
- [Multi-factor authentication](multi-factor-authentication-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Configure and test secondary authentication using a text message sent to your smart phone for an account in your Office 365 subscription.
    
- [Federated identity](federated-identity-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Configure and demonstrate federated authentication with the accounts of an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain.
    
- [Advanced Threat Protection](advanced-threat-protection-for-your-office-365-dev-test-environment.md)
    
    Configure and demonstrate Advanced Threat Protection, which is a feature of Exchange Online Protection (EOP) that helps keep malware out of your email.

## Simulated cross-premises dev/test environment

Create a [simulated intranet](simulated-cross-premises-virtual-network-in-azure.md) connected to an Azure virtual network in a hybrid cloud configuration.
    
## SharePoint Server 2016 dev/test environment

Build a [single-server SharePoint Server 2016 farm](https://docs.microsoft.com/SharePoint/administration/sharepoint-server-2016-dev-test-environment-in-azure) in Azure infrastructure services.

## Microsoft 365 Enterprise dev/test environment

Create a dev/test environment for [Microsoft 365 Enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/m365-enterprise-test-lab-guides).
