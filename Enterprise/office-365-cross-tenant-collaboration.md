# Office 365 cross-tenant collaboration

Learn how organizations can collaborate in a secure manner across Office 365 tenants.
  
  ### This needs a third level heading
  
Organizations can use Office 365 to collaborate on projects. For example, Skype for Business enables people to meet online, share files, and chat via instant messaging. Or, people can use Office 365 groups to have conversations, files, and calendar items all in one place.
  
Sometimes, an enterprise organization has a business need to collaborate with another organization using a different Office 365 tenant. Examples include sharing calendars with another organization, sharing sites and documents with external users, and collaborating in Yammer.
