# Choose between MDM for Office 365 and Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Intune and built-in Mobile Device Management for Office 365 both give you the ability to manage mobile devices in your organization. But there are key differences, described in the following table.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You can manage users and their mobile devices using both Intune and Office 365 in the same Office 365 tenant. Setting up both Intune and MDM lets you decide which solution is best for specific users and their devices. If you have both options available, you can choose whether you manage a user's devices with MDM for Office 365 or the more feature-rich Intune solution.
