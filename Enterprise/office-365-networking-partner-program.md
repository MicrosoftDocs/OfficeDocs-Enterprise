# Office 365 Networking Partner Program

Modern, scalable, Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud-ready, network connectivity is key to a successful digital transformation with Microsoft Office 365.  

As customers adopt Office 365 for business productivity, Microsoft has observed a common trend that network performance and the resulting end-user collaboration experience in Office 365 is directly influenced by network solutions in the path between the user and Office 365.  

Customers beginning their journey into the cloud are often challenged with transitioning from legacy, hub-and-spoke, datacenter-focused enterprise network and security architectures. And customers connecting to Office 365 over legacy networks may face performance issues when using the rich collaborative features in Office 365. The end goal for Office 365 customers is to modernize and optimize their enterprise networks to deliver a top-notch collaborative experience for their employees and partners, simplify IT management, and reduce costs. 

To modernize enterprise networks for great connectivity to Office 365, customers often rely on network solution providers, on-premises or cloud-based security services and system integrators to plan, design and implement network connectivity for cloud services. Customers often ask Microsoft whether their network architecture and solutions work with Office 365 and whether they align with Microsoft’s [Network Connectivity Principles for Office 365](http://aka.ms/PNC).  

Microsoft is committed in helping our customers build and optimize their network architecture connectivity for the best Office 365 experience. The Office 365 team is working with many network industry partners to help ensure that the key principles for optimal connectivity are natively built into their network product and solutions. 

With that, we’re thrilled to announce the Office 365 Networking Partner Program, with the goal to deepen the collaboration with network partners and identify key products and solutions that follow Microsoft’s Office 365 networking requirements, recommendations and best practices. 

The Microsoft Office 365 Networking Partner Program designates qualified networking solutions as “Works with Office 365”.  

Only devices or solutions that meet Microsoft’s rigorous testing requirements, have seamless experiences with setup, and demonstrate a high-quality networking experience when used with Office 365 will receive the “Works with Office 365” designation.  

Several networking solution providers are currently working with Microsoft to fulfill the requirements to receive the “Works with Office 365” designation. Details about how to set up those solutions for optimal Office 365 connectivity and performance will be published on this page.  

If you are an Office 365 customer, you can make your network solution provider aware of this program through this link [http://aka.ms/Office365NPP](http://aka.ms/Office365NPP).
