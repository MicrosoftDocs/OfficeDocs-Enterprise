# Deployment advisors for Office 365 or Microsoft 365 services

The deployment advisors for Office 365 or Microsoft 365 provide self-guided support for setting up Office 365 for your organization. To access them:

1. Sign in as a tenant administrator in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
