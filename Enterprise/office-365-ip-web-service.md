# **Office 365 IP Address and URL Web service**

To help you better identify and differentiate Office 365 network traffic, a new web service publishes Office 365 endpoints, making it easier for you to evaluate, configure, and stay up to date with changes. This new web service replaces the XML downloadable files that are currently available. The XML format is planned to be phased out on October 2, 2018.

As a customer or a network perimeter device vendor, you can build against the new REST-based web service for the Office 365 IP address and FQDN entries. You can access the data directly in a web browser using these URLs.

- For the latest version of the Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges, use [https://endpoints.office.com/version](https://endpoints.office.com/version?clientrequestid=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7).
- For the data on the Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges page for firewalls and proxy servers, use [https://endpoints.office.com/endpoints/worldwide](https://endpoints.office.com/endpoints/worldwide?clientrequestid=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7).
- To get all the latest changes since the end of July 2018 when the web service was first available, use [https://endpoints.office.com/changes/worldwide/0000000000](https://endpoints.office.com/changes/worldwide/0000000000?clientrequestid=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7).

As a customer, you can use this web service to:

- Update your PowerShell scripts to obtain Office 365 endpoint data and modify any formatting for your networking devices.
- Use this information to update PAC files deployed to client computers.

As a network perimeter device vendor, you can use this web service to:

- Create and test device software to download the list for automated configuration.
- Check for the current version.
- Get the current changes.

If you are using Azure ExpressRoute to connect to Office 365, Please review the article [Azure ExpressRoute for Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/azure-expressroute) to familiarize yourself with the Office 365 services supported over Azure ExpressRoute connectivity. Also review [Office 365 endpoints article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?redirectSourcePath=%252farticle%252fOffice-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2) to understand which network requests for these applications require Internet connectivity, This will help to better configure your perimeter security devices. 

For additional information, see:

- [Announcement blog post in the Office 365 Tech Community Forum](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365-Blog/Announcing-Office-365-endpoint-categories-and-Office-365-IP/ba-p/177638)
- [Office 365 Tech Community Forum for questions about use of the web services](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365-Networking/bd-p/Office365Networking)

## **Common parameters**

These parameters are common across all the web service methods:

- **format=CSV | JSON** - Query string parameter. By default, the returned data format is JSON. Include this optional parameter to return the data in comma-separated values (CSV) format.
- **ClientRequestId** - Query string parameter. A required GUID that you generate for client association. You should generate a GUID for each machine that calls the web service. Do not use the GUIDs shown in the following examples because they may be blocked by the web service in the future. GUID format is _xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_, where x represents a hexadecimal number. To generate a GUID, use the [New-Guid](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/new-guid?view=powershell-6) PowerShell command.

## **Version web method**

Microsoft updates the Office 365 IP address and FQDN entries at the end of each month and occasionally out of cycle for operational or support requirements. The data for each published instance is assigned a version number. The version web method lets you poll for the latest version for each Office 365 service instance. We recommend you check the version daily, or at the most, hourly. New versions should be expected at the start of each month. Sometimes due to support incident, security, or other operational requirements there will be new versions during the month.

There is one parameter for the version web method:

- **AllVersions=true** - Query string parameter. By default, the version returned is the latest. Include this optional parameter to request all published versions.
- **Format=JSON** | **CSV** | **RSS** â€“ In addition to the JSON and CSV formats, the version web method also supports RSS. You can use this along with the allVersions=true parameter to request an RSS feed which can be used with Outlook or other RSS readers.
- **Instance** - Route parameter. This optional parameter specifies the instance to return the version for. If omitted, all instances are returned. Valid instances are: Worldwide, China, Germany, USGovDoD, USGovGCCHigh.

The version web method is not rate limited and does not ever return 429 HTTP Response Codes. The response to the version web method does include a cache-control header recommending caching of the data for 1 hour. The result from the version web method may be a single record or an array of records. The elements of each record are:

- instance - The short name of the Office 365 service instance.
- latest - The latest version for endpoints of the specified instance.
- versions - A list of all previous versions for the specified instance. This element is only included if the AllVersions parameter is true.

You can use Microsoft Flow to get email notifications of changes to the IP Addresses and URLs. See [Use Microsoft Flow to receive an email for changes to Office 365 IP Addresses and URLs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365-Networking/Use-Microsoft-Flow-to-receive-an-email-for-changes-to-Office-365/m-p/240651).

### **Examples:**

Example 1 request URI: [https://endpoints.office.com/version?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7](https://endpoints.office.com/version?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7)

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The GUID for the ClientRequestID parameter in these URIs are only an example. To try the web service URIs out, generate your own GUID. The GUIDs shown in these examples may be blocked by the web service in the future.

Example 2 request URI: [https://endpoints.office.com/version/Worldwide?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7](https://endpoints.office.com/version/Worldwide?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7)

This URI returns the latest version of the specified Office 365 service instance. Example result:

```json
{
 "instance": "Worldwide",
 "latest": "2018063000"
}

```

Example 3 request URI: [https://endpoints.office.com/version/Worldwide?Format=CSV&amp;ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7](https://endpoints.office.com/version/Worldwide?Format=CSV&amp;ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7)

This URI shows all prior versions that have been published for the Office 365 worldwide service instance. Example result:

```json
{
  "instance": "Worldwide",
  "latest": "2018063000",
  "versions": [
    "2018063000",
    "2018062000"
  ]
}
```

Example 5 RSS Feed URI:
[https://endpoints.office.com/version/worldwide?clientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7&allVersions=true&format=RSS](https://endpoints.office.com/version/worldwide?clientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7&allVersions=true&format=RSS)

This URI shows an RSS feed of the published versions that include links to the list of changes for each version. Example result:

```

## **Endpoints web method**

The endpoints web method returns all records for IP address ranges and URLs that make up the Office 365 service. While the latest data from the endpoints web method should be used for network device configuration, the data can be cached for up to 30 days after it is published due to the advance notice provided for additions. We recommend you only call the endpoints web method again when the version web method indicates a new version of the data is available. Parameters for the endpoints web method are:

- **ServiceAreas** - Query string parameter. A comma-separated list of service areas. Valid items are Common,Exchange,SharePoint,Skype. Because Common service area items are a prerequisite for all other service areas, the web service will always include them. If you do not include this parameter, all service areas are returned.
- **TenantName** - Query string parameter. Your Office 365 tenant name. The web service takes your provided name and inserts it in parts of URLs that include the tenant name. If you don't provide a tenant name, those parts of URLs have the wildcard character (\*).
- **NoIPv6** - Query string parameter. Set this to true to exclude IPv6 addresses from the output, for example, if you don't use IPv6 in your network.
- **Instance** - Route parameter. This required parameter specifies the instance to return the endpoints for. Valid instances are: Worldwide, China, Germany, USGovDoD, USGovGCCHigh.

If you call the endpoints web method an unreasonable number of times from the same client IP Address you may receive HTTP Response Code 429 Too Many Requests. Most people will never see this. If you get this response code, you should wait 1 hour before calling the method again. Plan to only call the endpoints web method when the version web method indicates there is a new version available. 

The result from the endpoints web method is an array of records with each record representing an endpoint set. The elements for each record are:

- id - The immutable id number of the endpoint set.
- serviceArea - The service area that this is part of: Common, Exchange, SharePoint, or Skype.
- urls - URLs for the endpoint set. A JSON array of DNS records. Omitted if blank.
- tcpPorts - TCP ports for the endpoint set. All ports elements are formatted as a comma-separated list of ports or port ranges separated by a dash character (-). Ports apply to all IP addresses and all URLs in that endpoint set for that category. Omitted if blank.
- udpPorts - UDP ports for the IP address ranges in this endpoint set. Omitted if blank.
- ips - The IP address ranges associated with this endpoint set as associated with the listed TCP or UDP ports. A JSON array of IP Address ranges. Omitted if blank.
- category - The connectivity category for the endpoint set. Valid values are Optimize, Allow, and Default. If using the endpoint data to search for the category of an IP Address or URL, it is possible that your query may return multiple categories. There are a few reasons why that may happen. In these cases you should follow the recommendations for the highest priority category. For example, if the endpoint appears in both Optimize and Allow, you should follow the requirements for Optimize. Required. 
- expressRoute - True or False if this endpoint set is routed over ExpressRoute.
- required - True if this endpoint set is required to have connectivity for Office 365 to be supported. False if this endpoint set is optional.
- notes - For optional endpoints, this text describes Office 365 functionality that will be missing if IP addresses or URLs in this endpoint set cannot be accessed at the network layer. Omitted if blank.

### Examples:

Example 1 request URI: [https://endpoints.office.com/endpoints/Worldwide?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7](https://endpoints.office.com/endpoints/Worldwide?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7)

This URI obtains all endpoints for the Office 365 worldwide instance for all workloads. Example result showing an excerpt of the output:

```json
[
 {
  "id": 1,
  "serviceArea": "Exchange",
  "serviceAreaDisplayName": "Exchange Online",
  "urls":
   [
    "*.protection.outlook.com"
   ],
  "ips":
   [
    "2a01:111:f403::/48", "23.103.132.0/22", "23.103.136.0/21", "23.103.198.0/23", "23.103.212.0/22", "40.92.0.0/14", "40.107.0.0/17", "40.107.128.0/18", "52.100.0.0/14", "213.199.154.0/24", "213.199.180.128/26", "94.245.120.64/26", "207.46.163.0/24", "65.55.88.0/24", "216.32.180.0/23", "23.103.144.0/20", "65.55.169.0/24", "207.46.100.0/24", "2a01:111:f400:7c00::/54", "157.56.110.0/23", "23.103.200.0/22", "104.47.0.0/17", "2a01:111:f400:fc00::/54", "157.55.234.0/24", "157.56.112.0/24", "52.238.78.88/32"
   ],
  "tcpPorts": "443",
  "expressRoute": true,
  "category": "Allow"
 },
 {
  "id": 2,
  "serviceArea": "Exchange",
  "serviceAreaDisplayName": "Exchange Online",
  "urls":
   [
    "*.mail.protection.outlook.com"
   ],
...
```

Additional endpoint sets are not included in this example.

Example 2 request URI: [https://endpoints.office.com/endpoints/Worldwide?ServiceAreas=Exchange&amp;ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7](https://endpoints.office.com/endpoints/Worldwide?ServiceAreas=Exchange&amp;ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7)

This example obtains endpoints for the Office 365 Worldwide instance for Exchange Online and dependencies only.

The output for example 2 is similar to example 1 except that the results will not include endpoints for SharePoint Online or Skype for Business Online.

## Changes web method

The changes web method returns the most recent updates that have been published. This is typically the previous month's changes to IP address ranges and URLs. The most critical changes to be processed are when new URLs or IP Addresses are added since failing to add an IP Address to a firewall access control list, or a URL to a proxy server bypass list can cause an outage for Office 365 users behind that network device. Notwithstanding operational requirements, _Add_ operations are added with 30 days' notice before such an outage would occur.

The parameter for the changes web method is:

- **Version** - Required URL route parameter. The version that you have currently implemented, and you want to see the changes since that version. The format is _YYYYMMDDNN_.

The changes web method is rate limited in the same way as the endpoints web method. If you receive a 429 HTTP Response Code then you should wait 1 hour before calling again. 

The result from the changes web method is an array of records with each record representing a change in a specific version of the endpoints. The elements for each record are:

- id - The immutable id of the change record.
- endpointSetId - The ID of the endpoint set record that is changed. Required.
- disposition - This can be either of change, add, or remove and describes what the change did to the endpoint set record. Required.
- impact - Not all changes will be equally important to every environment. This describes the expected impact to an enterprise network perimeter environment as a result of this change. This attribute is included only in change records of version 2018112800 and later. Options for the impact are:
  - AddedIp â€“ An IP Address was added to Office 365 and will be live on the service soon. This represents a change you need to take on a firewall or other layer 3 network perimeter device. If you donâ€™t add this before we start using it, you may experience an outage.
  - AdedUrl â€“ A URL was added to Office 365 and will be live on the service soon. This represents a change you need to take on a proxy server or URL parsing network perimeter device. If you donâ€™t add this before we start using it, you may experience an outage.
  - AddedIpAndUrl - Both an IP Address and a URL were added. This represents a change you need to take on either a firewall layer 3 device or a proxy server or URL parsing device. If you donâ€™t add this before we start using it, you may experience an outage.
  - RemovedIpOrUrl â€“ At least one IP Address or URL was removed from Office 365. You should remove the network endpoints from your perimeter devices, but thereâ€™s no deadline for you to do this.
  - ChangedIsExpressRoute â€“ The ExpressRoute support attribute was changed. If you use ExpressRoute then you may need to take action depending on your configuration.
  - MovedIpOrUrl â€“ We moved an IP Address or Url between this endpoint set and another one. Generally no action is required.
  - RemovedDuplicateIpOrUrl â€“ We removed a duplicate IP Address or Url but itâ€™s still published for Office 365. Generally no action is required.
  - OtherNonPriorityChanges â€“ We changed something less critical than all of the other options like a note field
- version - The version of the published endpoint set in which the change was introduced. Version numbers are of the format _YYYYMMDDNN_, where NN is a natural number incremented if there are multiple versions required to be published on a single day.
- previous - A substructure detailing previous values of changed elements on the endpoint set. This will not be included for newly added endpoint sets. Includes tcpPorts, udpPorts, ExpressRoute, category, required, notes.
- current - A substructure detailing updated values of changes elements on the endpoint set. Includes tcpPorts, udpPorts, ExpressRoute, category, required, notes.
- add - A substructure detailing items to be added to endpoint set collections. Omitted if there are no additions.
  - effectiveDate - Defines the data when the additions will be live in the service.
  - ips - Items to be added to the ips array.
  - urls- Items to be added to the urls array.
- remove - A substructure detailing items to be removed from the endpoint set. Omitted if there are no removals.
  - ips - Items to be removed from the ips array.
  - urls- Items to be removed from the urls array.

### **Examples:**

Example 1 request URI: [https://endpoints.office.com/changes/worldwide/0000000000?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7](https://endpoints.office.com/changes/worldwide/0000000000?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7)

This requests all previous changes to the Office 365 worldwide service instance. Example result:

```json
[
 {
  "id": 424,
  "endpointSetId": 32,
  "disposition": "Change",
  "version": "2018062700",
  "remove":
   {
    "urls":
     [
      "*.api.skype.com", "skypegraph.skype.com"
     ]
   }
 },
 {
  "id": 426,
  "endpointSetId": 31,
  "disposition": "Change",
  "version": "2018062700",
  "add":
   {
    "effectiveDate": "20180609",
    "ips":
     [
      "51.140.203.190/32"
     ]
   },
  "remove":
   {
    "ips":
     [
...
```

Example 2 request URI: [https://endpoints.office.com/changes/worldwide/2018062700?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7](https://endpoints.office.com/changes/worldwide/2018062700?ClientRequestId=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7)

This requests changes since the specified version to the Office 365 Worldwide instance. In this case, the version specified is the latest. Example result:

```json
[
  {
    "id":3,
    "endpointSetId":33,
    "changeDescription":"Removing old IP prefixes",
    "disposition":"Change",
    "version":"2018031301",
    "remove":{
      "ips":["65.55.127.0/24","66.119.157.192/26","66.119.158.0/25",
      "111.221.76.128/25","111.221.77.0/26","207.46.5.0/24"]
    }
  },
  {
    "id":4,
    "endpointSetId":45,
    "changeDescription":"Removing old IP prefixes",
    "disposition":"Change",
    "version":"2018031301",
    "remove":{
      "ips":["13.78.93.8/32","40.113.87.220/32","40.114.149.220/32",
      "40.117.100.83/32","40.118.214.164/32","104.208.31.113/32"]
    }
  }
]
```

## **Example PowerShell Script**

Here is a PowerShell script that you can run to see if there are actions you need to take for updated data. This script checks the version number for the Office 365 Worldwide instance endpoints. When there is a change, it downloads the endpoints and filters for the &quot;Allow&quot; and &quot;Optimize&quot; category endpoints. It also uses a unique ClientRequestId across multiple calls and saves the latest version found in a temporary file. You should call this script once an hour to check for a version update.

```powershell
# webservice root URL
$ws = "https://endpoints.office.com"
# path where client ID and latest version number will be stored
$datapath = $Env:TEMP + "\endpoints_clientid_latestversion.txt"
# fetch client ID and version if data file exists; otherwise create new file
if (Test-Path $datapath) {
    $content = Get-Content $datapath
    $clientRequestId = $content[0]
    $lastVersion = $content[1]
}
else {
    $clientRequestId = [GUID]::NewGuid().Guid
    $lastVersion = "0000000000"
    @($clientRequestId, $lastVersion) | Out-File $datapath
}
# call version method to check the latest version, and pull new data if version number is different
$version = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri ($ws + "/version/Worldwide?clientRequestId=" + $clientRequestId)
if ($version.latest -gt $lastVersion) {
    Write-Host "New version of Office 365 worldwide commercial service instance endpoints detected"

    # write the new version number to the data file
    @($clientRequestId, $version.latest) | Out-File $datapath
    # invoke endpoints method to get the new data
    $endpointSets = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri ($ws + "/endpoints/Worldwide?clientRequestId=" + $clientRequestId)
    # filter results for Allow and Optimize endpoints, and transform these into custom objects with port and category
    $flatUrls = $endpointSets | ForEach-Object {
        $endpointSet = $_
        $urls = $(if ($endpointSet.urls.Count -gt 0) { $endpointSet.urls } else { @() })
        $urlCustomObjects = @()
        if ($endpointSet.category -in ("Allow", "Optimize")) {
            $urlCustomObjects = $urls | ForEach-Object {
                [PSCustomObject]@{
                    category = $endpointSet.category;
                    url      = $_;
                    tcpPorts = $endpointSet.tcpPorts;
                    udpPorts = $endpointSet.udpPorts;
                }
            }
        }
        $urlCustomObjects
    }
    $flatIps = $endpointSets | ForEach-Object {
        $endpointSet = $_
        $ips = $(if ($endpointSet.ips.Count -gt 0) { $endpointSet.ips } else { @() })
        # IPv4 strings have dots while IPv6 strings have colons
        $ip4s = $ips | Where-Object { $_ -like '*.*' }

        $ipCustomObjects = @()
        if ($endpointSet.category -in ("Allow", "Optimize")) {
            $ipCustomObjects = $ip4s | ForEach-Object {

## **Example Python Script**

Here is a Python script, tested with Python 3.6.3 on Windows 10, that you can run to see if there are actions you need to take for updated data. This script checks the version number for the Office 365 Worldwide instance endpoints. When there is a change, it downloads the endpoints and filters for the _Allow_ and _Optimize_ category endpoints. It also uses a unique ClientRequestId across multiple calls and saves the latest version found in a temporary file. You should call this script once an hour to check for a version update.

```python
import json
import os
import urllib.request
import uuid
# helper to call the webservice and parse the response
def webApiGet(methodName, instanceName, clientRequestId):
    ws = "https://endpoints.office.com"
    requestPath = ws + '/' + methodName + '/' + instanceName + '?clientRequestId=' + clientRequestId
    request = urllib.request.Request(requestPath)
    with urllib.request.urlopen(request) as response:
        return json.loads(response.read().decode())
# path where client ID and latest version number will be stored
datapath = os.environ['TEMP'] + '\endpoints_clientid_latestversion.txt'
# fetch client ID and version if data exists; otherwise create new file
if os.path.exists(datapath):
    with open(datapath, 'r') as fin:
        clientRequestId = fin.readline().strip()
        latestVersion = fin.readline().strip()
else:
    clientRequestId = str(uuid.uuid4())
    latestVersion = '0000000000'
    with open(datapath, 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(clientRequestId + '\n' + latestVersion)
# call version method to check the latest version, and pull new data if version number is different
version = webApiGet('version', 'Worldwide', clientRequestId)
if version['latest'] > latestVersion:
    print('New version of Office 365 worldwide commercial service instance endpoints detected')
    # write the new version number to the data file
    with open(datapath, 'w') as fout:
        fout.write(clientRequestId + '\n' + version['latest'])
    # invoke endpoints method to get the new data
    endpointSets = webApiGet('endpoints', 'Worldwide', clientRequestId)
    # filter results for Allow and Optimize endpoints, and transform these into tuples with port and category
    flatUrls = []
    for endpointSet in endpointSets:
        if endpointSet['category'] in ('Optimize', 'Allow'):
            category = endpointSet['category']
            urls = endpointSet['urls'] if 'urls' in endpointSet else []
            tcpPorts = endpointSet['tcpPorts'] if 'tcpPorts' in endpointSet else ''
            udpPorts = endpointSet['udpPorts'] if 'udpPorts' in endpointSet else ''
            flatUrls.extend([(category, url, tcpPorts, udpPorts) for url in urls])
    flatIps = []
    for endpointSet in endpointSets:
        if endpointSet['category'] in ('Optimize', 'Allow'):
            ips = endpointSet['ips'] if 'ips' in endpointSet else []
            category = endpointSet['category']
            # IPv4 strings have dots while IPv6 strings have colons
            ip4s = [ip for ip in ips if '.' in ip]
            tcpPorts = endpointSet['tcpPorts'] if 'tcpPorts' in endpointSet else ''
            udpPorts = endpointSet['udpPorts'] if 'udpPorts' in endpointSet else ''
            flatIps.extend([(category, ip, tcpPorts, udpPorts) for ip in ip4s])
    print('IPv4 Firewall IP Address Ranges')
    print(','.join(sorted(set([ip for (category, ip, tcpPorts, udpPorts) in flatIps]))))
    print('URLs for Proxy Server')
    print(','.join(sorted(set([url for (category, url, tcpPorts, udpPorts) in flatUrls]))))

    # TODO send mail (e.g. with smtplib/email modules) with new endpoints data
else:
    print('Office 365 worldwide commercial service instance endpoints are up-to-date')
```

## **Web Service interface versioning**

Updates to the parameters or results for these web service methods may be required in the future. After the general availability version of these web services is published, Microsoft will make reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of material updates to the web service. When Microsoft believes that an update will require changes to clients using the web service, Microsoft will keep the previous version (one version back) of the web service available for at least twelve (12) months after the release of the new version. Customers who do not upgrade during that time may be unable to access the web service and its methods. Customers must ensure that clients of the web service continue working without error if the following changes are made to the web service interface signature:

- Adding a new optional parameter to an existing web method that doesn't have to be provided by older clients and doesn't impact the result an older client receives.
- Adding a new named attribute in one of the response REST items or additional columns to the response CSV.
- Adding a new web method with a new name that is not called by the older clients.
